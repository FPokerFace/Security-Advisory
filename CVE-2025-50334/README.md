# Security Advisory: Denial of Service in Technitium DNS Server Rate Limiting

- **Status:** Fixed in the latest Technitium DNS Server releases (version 14.0)
- **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) against legitimate DNS clients/resolvers
- **Access Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated  
- **CVE:** CVE-2025-50334  
- **Published Date (Vendors):** 8th November 2025
- **Affects:** Technitium DNS Server up to and including 13.6
- **Not affected:** Technitium DNS Server version 14.0
- **Impact:** Remote Denial of Service against legitimate DNS clients/resolvers via subnet-wide blacklisting
- **Severity:** High  
- **CVSS v3.1:** 7.5, see https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Our team identified a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the rate-limiting implementation of Technitium DNS Server.  

Under the default configuration, a remote attacker who can spoof source IP addresses can abuse the rate-limiting mechanism to temporarily block legitimate DNS traffic for entire IPv4 /24 or IPv6 /56 subnets.

This issue affects Technitium DNS Server both when it is deployed as a **recursive resolver** and when it operates as an **authoritative name server**.

This issue has been fixed in version 14.0. The DNS Server now has a redesigned rate-limiting implementation with different Queries Per Minute (QPM) options in Settings that help mitigate this issue.
